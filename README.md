# Regression-Model.

##First Regression Model.

Applying regression techniques to analyze a marketing campaign dataset, this project aims to understand the relationships between advertising expenditures and sales returns. Regression models are among the most widely used machine learning models in the industry, making this analysis highly relevant.

##Introduction.

A company invests monthly in online advertising platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Newspapers to attract leads (potential customers). To track the performance of these investments, the company records all advertising expenditures and the corresponding sales returns generated. To better understand the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales returns, and to identify the factors that most significantly impact lead generation, the company has requested an analysis of the data. Additionally, the company aims to create a predictive model to estimate the sales returns based on a given investment in advertising.

##Steps:

      1. Import the Dataset: Use a data manipulation library to import the dataset, understand the Data to explore the dataset to identify any inconsistencies, such as missing values, duplicate data, or outliers.
      2. Descriptive Analysis: Conduct a descriptive analysis of the variables to summarize their main characteristics.
      3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use graphs and visualizations to identify patterns, relationships, and trends between variables, and investigate possible correlations.
      4. Build the Regression Model: Assemble and train a regression model to predict sales returns based on advertising expenditures.

By following these steps, the company can gain valuable insights into its advertising investments and optimize its marketing strategies for better returns.
